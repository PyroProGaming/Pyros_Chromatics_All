# Pyros_Chromatics_All
These are a collection of all my chromatic scales I've made.

They will be categorised, and you will be able to find all the ones I have made.
You will NOT find any that are made by others or are used in covers I make, if you want a chromatic you can contact me.
All chromatics, no matter what will be posted here for public use.

Please give me credit if you use any of these, and it would be nice if you could contact me before hand.

My discord is pyro#4030 and will most likely stay pyro#4030.

If any questions are raised either reach out on my twitter (inactive) youtube (I check everyday) or my discord (which as explained above is pyro#4030).

Youtube - PyroProTalks

If you use any chroms for a private cover you don't need to credit me, private covers include:

DMs
Not going up on streaming services

Have fun! 

-- Pyro
